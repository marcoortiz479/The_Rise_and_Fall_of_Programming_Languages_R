# 📉 The Rise and Fall of Programming Languages | R

This R-based project analyzes the popularity trends of programming languages over time, using a dataset of tag usage by year. The insights are visualized through time series plots and exploratory data analysis.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `notebook.ipynb`: The analysis exported from an R Markdown notebook or conducted via R in Jupyter using the IRKernel.
- `by_tag_year.csv`: The dataset containing yearly usage counts of programming language tags (e.g., from Stack Overflow or similar sources).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore how programming language popularity has shifted over time.
- Identify rising, declining, and stable languages.
- Create clear visualizations to support observations.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **R**
- **tidyverse** (for data manipulation and plotting)
- **ggplot2** (for data visualization)
- **readr** (for CSV import)
- **dplyr** (for wrangling)
